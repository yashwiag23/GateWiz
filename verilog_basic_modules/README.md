This folder contains fundamental digital design modules implemented in Verilog. 

Modules include combinational logic (adder, subtractor, mux/demux) and sequential logic (flip-flop). 

Each module is accompanied by a testbench and GTKWave output to simulate and verify its functionality.

This collection is intended for learning and practice in digital logic design.
